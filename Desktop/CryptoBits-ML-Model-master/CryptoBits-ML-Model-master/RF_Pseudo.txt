1. Get the data from API or Dataset
data = getData()

2. Define list of features to extract and divide data into training and testing sets:
Training set => df_train = data[from 0 to (size(data) - results)]
Testing set => df_test = data[from (size(data) - results) to end]

3. Extract features and target values:
Training features => xTrain = df_train[features]
Training target => yTrain = df_train["Close"]
Testing features => xTest = df_test[features]
Testing target => yTest = df_test["Close"]

4. Create a Random Forest Regressor
rf = RandomForestRegressor(estimators_count = 1000)

5. Train the model on the training data:
rf.fit(xTrain, yTrain)

6. Make predictions on the testing data:
predictions = rf.predict(xTest)

7. Return the final predictions:
return finalPredictions
